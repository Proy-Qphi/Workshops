## Small Area Estimation with R - Virgilio GÃ³mez-Rubio (Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Spain)
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

The tutorial will introduce different types of statistical methods for the
analysis of survey data to produce estimates for small domains (sometimes
termed 'small areas'). This will include design-based estimators, that are only
based on the study design and observed data, and model-based estimators, that
rely on an underlying model to provide estimates. The tutorial
will cover frequentist and Bayesian inference for Small Area Estimation.
All methods will be accompanied by several examples that attendants will be able to reproduce.
 
**Plan of the workshop**

The tutorial will use some case studies to present the main statistical
methods in Small Area Estimation. This includes:

* Short introduction to survey sampling strategies with R: simple random
sampling, systematic sampling, clustered sampling, two-stage sampling
* Design based-estimators: Horvitz-Thompson, generalized regression (GREG) and calibration estimators
* Model-based estimators: Fay-Herriott estimator, linear regression for
area and unit level models
* Synthetic and composite estimators
* Mixed-effects models: area and unit level models with random effects, EBLUP estimators
* Models with spatial random effects: spatial EBLUP for area and unit level models
* Bayesian inference for Small Area Estimation: area and unit level models
* Non-linear models: disease mapping, estimation of unemployment
