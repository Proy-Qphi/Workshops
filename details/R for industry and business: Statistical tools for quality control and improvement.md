## R for industry and business: Statistical tools for quality control and improvement - Emilio L. Cano (The University of Castilla-La Mancha)

Workshop materials at: http://emilio.lcano.com/erum

**Description of proposed workshop**

The aim of this workshop is twofold: bringing R to industry and business, and
improving industry and business skills of R users. The former is really
challenging due to the fact that many companies are still reluctant to
free software. Nevertheless, this situation is gradually changing and there
are more and more people working at companies using R packages and providing feedback about their experience, which means that the time for R in industry is coming; the latter is indeed needed in order to provide industry with
R experts trained in quality methodologies and avoid a shortage
of professionals in the near future.
The tools addressed in the workshop are based in two publications coauthored by the workshop trainer, namely:

- Six Sigma with R (Springer, 2012). http://www.sixsigmawithr.com
- Quality Control with R (Springer, 2015). http://www.qualitycontrolwithr.com

Moreover, similar in-company courses have been given by the author in Spain.
 
**Plan of the workshop**

Even though it is not possible to go in depth through all the quality control and improvement tools in three hours, five topics are planned to be covered:

* Basic tools
* Control Charts
* Process Capability Analysis
* Measurement Systems Analysis
* Effective Reporting

Each topic will consist of a 15 minutes presentation, and 15 minutes for
practice with provided code files and/or data sets. In addition, two general presentations will start and finish the workshop with a brief introduction and a summary of other tools respectively.

Code, data, and handouts will be available for downloading before the workshop.

**Required packages**

qcc, SixSigma, qualityTools, AcceptanceSampling, qicharts.

RStudio is strongly recommended, though not mandatory.

**Required skills of participants**

The workshop is suitable for three different types of attendees according to
their interests:

* NewcomeRs from industry. People that are currently using other Statistical
software to perform statistical quality control and improvement techniques
(SPC, Six Sigma, ...) and need to have a global view of the R capabilities
for future use. They could attend and follow the workshop without practicing,
just taking notes. Required skills of this group include quality methodologies,
business, and management;

* Quality Control and Improvement practitioners that have started to use R
(or at least are ready to install and interact with it) and need to improve
their R skills in order to successfully use it in a production environment.
Required skills of this group include quality methodologies, basic programming,
and basic Statistics;

* R users that want to learn about applied statistical techniques
for quality control and improvement in order to improve their skills looking at
industry and business. Required skills of this group include
R programming, Statistics, and notions of process management.

**Required work to do before workshop**

Those attendees planning to follow the workshop practicing should bring their
laptops with R, RStudio, and the required packages installed. Nevertheless,
during the workshop introduction there will be some time to download,
install and/or configure the tools.

Downloading in advance the documentation and example data for the workshop is also advisable.
