## Predictive modeling with R - Artur Suchwałko (Instructor at QuantUp (Poland) ||| co-owner / CSO / Vice-CEO at MedicWave (Sweden))
 
Description of proposed workshop
* The participants will understand how to do predictive modeling (classification) in R with `caret` package.
* They will get practical skills and a script facilitating further building of classification models on their own.
 
Plan of the workshop
* In short about predictive modeling (classification)
* Data reading and basic preprocessing
* Building a classifier
* Assessing predictive power
* Comparing models
* Tuning parameters
 
Required packages
* caret
* C50
* ... (more will be specified)
 
Required skills of participants
* basic knowledge of R, it means at least once in a lifetime wrote a R code for any purpose
* some familiarity with data analysis in any tool
* some knowledge of predictive modeling (classification) is a plus but not a requirement
 
Required work to do before workshop
* bring hardware: own laptop, doesn't have to be powerful
* install software: recent R and RStudio installations
* install packages: caret, C50, ... (more will be specified)
* get familiar with data: library(C50); data(churn)
 
Research experience
* Ph.D. in mathematics at TUoW (Technical University of Wroclaw)
* research and teaching assistant at Biomedical Engineering Institute of TUoW
* author and co-author of over a dozen of scientific papers (operational research and biomedical engineering)
