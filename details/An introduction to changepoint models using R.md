## An introduction to changepoint models using R - Rebecca Killick (Lancaster University)
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

More data is being collected in the world today than ever before resulting in larger and longer data sets. With the length of data sets increasing, the statistical properties of the data are likely to change over time. Traditional statistical methods often make the assumption that the statistical properties do not change over time and thus can lead to incorrect conclusions when changes occur.
A common method for relaxing this assumption is to segment the data into smaller periods within which the statistical properties do not change. One advantage of this technique is that the traditional (stationary) methods can be utilized on the individual segments. The points in time when the statistical properties change are referred to as changepoints.

This course introduces participants to the analysis of changepoint models (also known as time series segmentation or structural changes). The course is aimed at those with an interest in discovering methods for models that include changepoints. It is interactive and uses packages available on CRAN.

Techniques covered in this course include: likelihood and nonparametric methods for detecting changes in mean, regression and variance. Each topic is explained theoretically and demonstrated using real data sets from a variety of application areas including finance, genomics and environment.

Following the course participants will be able to:
- recognize datasets that potentially contain changepoints
- identify appropriate changepoint methods dependent on the type of change suspected
- perform changepoint analyses using a variety of techniques in R
- summarize and evaluate results of a changepoint analysis
- check assumptions made within a changepoint analysis
